# Pub/Sub pattern

#### While writing these codes, I was inspired by a blog post.
#### I did a little experiment to better understand the pub/sub pattern.
#### I may have many mistakes, don't forget to report what you see.

## use case

* create a broker as a first step.
* then assign a new subscriber value to the broker value using the AddSubscriber method.
* You can listen to this subscribe value you created with the Listen method.
* If you don't want to use it, you can write your own method.
